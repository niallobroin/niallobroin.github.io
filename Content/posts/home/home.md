Moon Rise at Everest Base Camp:<br />
This is actually the Moon rising behind Mount Everest.<br />
The bright spots are the camera flash reflecting off the lightly falling snow. <br />
Thanks Teo for the photo.

Highest Person:<br/> 
Aconcagua, Argentina, the highest peak outside Himalaya.
It's a chance to be the highest person on Earth for a moment as its night time and winter in the Himalaya, and therfore unlikely to be climbers on higher mountains.

Fall To The Left:<br/>
Taken from just below the summit of Denali, this ridge
is the most exciting part of the climb.
If you fall to the right, its 3000m down, and if you fall to the left its 4000m down.
Best advice is to fall to the left as you will live longer.

Denali Summit Push:<br>
Taken on the way to the summit at about 6100m.<br /> Look for climbers on the trail about 1000m below in the bottom right of the image.
