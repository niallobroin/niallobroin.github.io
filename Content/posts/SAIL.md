Jokers to the right: <br />
This is the finish line of the Round Ireland, a 5 day non-stop race circumnavigating Ireland.<br />
Now, I can definitely confirm that Ireland is indeed an island.

Overview Effect:<br />
Sailing a boat from Mallorca to Gran Canaria, and on the 5 day non-stop leg from Gibraltar,
I witnessed the rising and setting of the Sun and Full Moon, 180deg from each other.
Over the 5 days their positions changed.
