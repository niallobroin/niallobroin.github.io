A while back I came across [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com) - which was basically Jekyll but made it easier to create a Jekyll blog, by getting rid of a lot of the up front setup.

- You don't need to touch the command line
- You don't need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems :relaxed:
- You don't need to install runtime dependencies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc
- If you're on Windows, this will make setting up Jekyll a lot easier
- It's easy to try out, you can just delete your forked repository if you don't like it

In a few minutes you'll be set up with a responsive blog / website hosted on [Aerobatic](https://www.aerobatic.com)

For the past couple of years - it hasn't been update so I decided to do a bit of updating - basically for my own use but still make it available for others.

The good thing about Jekyll / Jekyll Now is that it is lightweight and not only for blogs but it is possible to develop fully functional web sites using it as a backbone. You can also host and deploy it free with Bitbucket and Github

With [Jekyll Now REDUX](https://jekyll-now-redux.aerobatic.io) , I have used a new theme - the same theme I have used for this blog for now but will at some point change it. I have also update the configuration slightly - giving a bit more functionality.

To get started is really simple:

### Step 1)
 Clone or download Jekyll Now to your desktop / development folder - or where ever you wish to work on your blog

### Step 2)
 Upload the contents of `_site` folder to your web host.

### Step 3)
 View your new website / blog.

As mentioned - with Bitbucket ( where I tend to host my personal projects ), you can also set up and run your site using Aerobatic.

If you fancy giving it a shot have a look at the [Jekyll Now REDUX](https://jekyll-now-redux.aerobatic.io) website where you can find the full instructions on how to set up your Jekyll Now REDUX website with Aerobatic or check it out on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/dyoungwd/jekyll-now)
